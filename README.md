NBA Play - Guess the Player NBA Project

This project is a game where users have one minute to guess as many NBA players as they can. When the user starts the game, we will show the user a random active NBA player, and they have the option of either inputting the
player's name or skipping the player if they do know the player's name. Throughoug the minute, the game keeps track of the user's score, and once the minute ends, the score gets saved automatically to the user's account if
they are logged in. Logged In users have the option to view their previous result and sort them by date and score. If a user has scored high enough, their result will be displayed on our top-10 all time leaderboard.

On the home page, players can also generate up to 12 random players, along with either current or historic players. Note that most historic players do not have images, so their names may only display.
